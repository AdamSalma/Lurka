# Lurka/Services

### What they do
Services are components that are attached to the React DOM tree but do not render any html.

They listen to events and perform different functions based on the service type.

# Examples

### Watcher
Polls a url at given intervals and triggers an action when the url's content is updated via the "Last-Modified" http header.
Is used to watch 4chan threads in the background to allow the user to be notified when an update occurs.

### Preloader
Loads the initial content if none is available. Performs two requests: get the 4chan boardList, and get the "default" board to start on.

### Theme
Injects CSS4 variables into the DOM and listens for an updateTheme event which will save the updated theme in the browser (localStorage)

### Context Menu
Listens for a Open/Close event and appends a context menu to the DOM then positions it in relation to the users cursor.
